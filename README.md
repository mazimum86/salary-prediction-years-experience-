# Salary Prediction Based on Years of Experience

This project explores how different regression algorithms can predict employee salary using years of experience as input. The goal is to compare models and determine which provides the most accurate predictions.

## Models Used
- Linear Regression
- Polynomial Regression
- Decision Tree Regression
- Random Forest Regression
- Support Vector Regression (SVR)

## Tools
- Python (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib)
- R (base R, ggplot2, caret)
- GitHub for version control and collaboration

## Dataset
The dataset consists of 30 samples with two features:
- `YearsExperience`: Number of years of experience
- `Salary`: Corresponding annual salary

## Outputs
- Visual comparisons between models
- Evaluation metrics (RÂ² Score, MSE, MAE)
- Model selection based on performance

## How to Use
1. Clone the repo
2. Open `/python` or `/r` folder
3. Run individual model scripts
